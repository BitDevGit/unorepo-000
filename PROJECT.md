# Unorepo Builder - Project Vision

## Overview

A **visual monorepo orchestration platform** that transforms monorepo management from command-line operations into an intuitive, drag-and-drop experience.

## The Vision

Enable developers to:
- Browse and manage packages through a visual UI
- Compose projects by dragging and dropping components
- Visualize dependencies and relationships
- Generate production-ready code automatically
- Deploy to Vercel with one click

## Why This Matters

### Current Pain Points
- **Complexity**: Monorepos require deep CLI knowledge
- **Discovery**: Hard to find and understand available packages
- **Composition**: No visual way to see how components fit together
- **Onboarding**: New developers struggle with monorepo structure
- **Consistency**: Hard to enforce standards across packages

### Our Solution
- **Visual Interface**: Drag-and-drop component composition
- **Centralized Registry**: Browse all packages in one place
- **Smart Generation**: Automated project scaffolding
- **Real-time Validation**: Catch issues before building
- **Git Integration**: Seamless GitHub and Vercel deployment

## Key Features

### 1. Package Registry
Browse, search, and manage packages with tagging, categorization, and dependency tracking.

### 2. Template System
JSON-based templates with variable substitution and automated file generation.

### 3. Visual Builder
React Flow-based drag-and-drop interface for composing projects visually.

### 4. Project Generator
Automated scaffolding with configuration generation and build pipeline setup.

### 5. Git Integration
GitHub repository creation, automated commits, and Vercel deployment.

## Target Users

- **Frontend Developers** - Building component libraries
- **DevOps Engineers** - Managing infrastructure packages
- **Design System Teams** - Maintaining design tokens
- **Product Teams** - Rapid prototyping
- **Open Source Maintainers** - Managing multi-package projects

## Development Phases

1. **Foundation** - Turborepo, database, auth, UI shell
2. **Package Registry** - CRUD, search, metadata
3. **Templates** - Template management and engine
4. **Visual Builder** - React Flow integration
5. **Generator** - Code generation and build pipeline
6. **Git Integration** - GitHub and Vercel deployment
7. **Advanced** - Collaboration, analytics, optimization

## Long-term Vision

Evolve into a complete **no-code software composition platform** with:
- AI-assisted component selection
- Marketplace for templates and components
- Collaborative editing and team workspaces
- Enterprise features (SSO, audit logs, compliance)

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Visual-First** - Only platform with drag-and-drop monorepo composition
2. **Vercel Native** - Deep integration with Vercel ecosystem
3. **Best Practices** - Enforces standards through templates
4. **Real-time Validation** - Catch issues before generation
5. **One-Click Deploy** - From design to production instantly
