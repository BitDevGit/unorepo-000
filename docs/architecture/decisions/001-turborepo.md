# ADR 001: Use Turborepo for Monorepo Management

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-06  
**Deciders**: Core Team

## Context

We need a build system that can efficiently manage multiple packages and applications in a monorepo structure while maintaining fast build times and good developer experience.

## Decision

We will use Turborepo as our monorepo build system.

## Rationale

### Why Turborepo?

1. **Performance**: Intelligent caching and parallel execution
2. **Vercel Integration**: Native support and remote caching
3. **Simple Configuration**: Minimal setup compared to alternatives
4. **Pipeline Management**: Clear task dependencies
5. **Developer Experience**: Fast, predictable builds

### Alternatives Considered

- **Nx**: More features but steeper learning curve
- **Lerna**: Older, less performant
- **Rush**: Microsoft-backed but complex setup
- **pnpm workspaces alone**: No build orchestration

## Consequences

### Positive
- Faster builds with intelligent caching
- Better CI/CD performance
- Clear task dependencies
- Easy to understand for new developers

### Negative
- Learning curve for Turborepo-specific concepts
- Dependency on Vercel ecosystem
- Less flexible than Nx for complex scenarios

## Implementation

\`\`\`json
// turbo.json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": [".next/**", "dist/**"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": true
    }
  }
}
